Requirements
------------

- [Julia](http://julialang.org/)
- [LatBo.jl](https://github.com/UCL/LatBo.jl): comes as a git submodule of this
  repo
- [dexy](http://dexy.it/): The idea is to mesh the code and the unit-tests
  directly from the LatBo.jl repo. That way we're never showing off
  toy-problems with toy-solutions. It will lileky mean refactoring the tests
  and/or the code.
